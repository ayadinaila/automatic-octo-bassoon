INTRO: In my training with gomycode , as a student one of my projects was solving some problems using the necessary skills to dive deeper in AI. This repository represents my solutions of the second checkpoint of my training. Where we learnt how to solve many cases using Python and some others modules like Pandas and Numpy. Questions: 1- Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a list. 2- Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given number. 3- With a given integer number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary. 4- Given a non-empty string and an int n, return a new string where the char at index n has been removed. The value of n will be a valid index of a char in the original string 5- Write a NumPy program to convert a NumPy array into a Python list structure. 6- Write a NumPy program to compute the covariance matrix of two given arrays. 7- Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula: Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
